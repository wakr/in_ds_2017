## Background

Chicago is being notorious for its violent crime rate, topping many major US city in violent crimes [1]. 

Crimes are usually not evenly distributed across a city, and a person who might be interested to move to Chicago would probably want to see which areas are worse inside Chicago. Based on that data, a new candidate could compare between areas inside Chicago and choose a more crime-free district to live. The data about these bad areas gives also insight to the police department and helps to pinpoint crime clusters, which often are formed due to sociological differences i.e. poverty and education. 

Taking a look at just shootings happened during this year in Chicago shows couple of these clusters

Tackling with these crime clusters would make the city safer, even though there might be internal problems [in the police department](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-chicago-police/chicagos-detective-force-dwindles-as-murder-rate-soars-idUSKCN10Z13A). The other problem are [guns](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/02/us/chicago-murder-rate-2016-visual-guide/index.html) which are hard to get rid of, even with strict gun laws.

However, data about crime types and counts provides valuable information about the current state of crimes in Chicago. We believe that smaller crimes, create *butterfly effect* which will ultimately reflect to more serious crimes over time.

The data we use are crimes in non-murder crimes from 2010 to 2016 and school inquiries/statistics to form a forecast for 2017. This raises couple of questions that can be answered
* How crime rate in Chicago is going to change in future?
* How crimes are distributed inside Chicago?
* Does there exists a possible relationship to schooling
